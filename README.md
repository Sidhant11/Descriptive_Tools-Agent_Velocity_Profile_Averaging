Average_vel.c provides spatial averaging of agents and bins them as a function of a particular spatial dimension. 
Code has capabilities of generating a time-series averaging for the given spatial dimension as well.
Dynamics3D needs to be run prior to running Average_vel.c to generate T.txt to be used as input.
Attached are results of short-time and long-time particle velocity averaging as a function of the y-dimension.
In a simple shear flow short-time dynamics shows traces of shear banding (non-linear velocity profile) while long-time dynamics does not.
